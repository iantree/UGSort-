# UGSort- A testbed for the UGSort algorithm
The UGSort algorithm is a novel merge based sorting algorithm. This project provides a minimally optimised, lightly instrumented testbed for 
exploring the performance profile of the algorithm.
The UGSort application is a C++ generic sort application for sorting text files with fixed length keys.
The project includes papers describing the algorithm as well as a detailed emprical study of the performance profile.
